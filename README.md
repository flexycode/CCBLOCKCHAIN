# 💫 Blockchain 101

What is blockchain?
Blockchain technology is an advanced database mechanism that allows transparent information sharing within a business network. A blockchain database stores data in blocks that are linked together in a chain.

What is blockchain and how does it work?
First and foremost, blockchain is a public electronic ledger built around a P2P system that can be openly shared among disparate users to create an unchangeable record of transactions, each time-stamped and linked to the previous one. Every time a set of transactions is added, that data becomes another block in the chain (hence, the name).

Blockchain can only be updated by consensus between participants in the system, and once new data is entered it can never be erased. It is a write-once, append-many technology, making it a verifiable and auditable record of each and every transaction.

While it has great potential, blockchain technology development is still early days; CIOs and their business counterparts should expect setbacks in deploying the technology, including the real possibility of serious bugs in the software used atop blockchain. And as some companies have already discovered, it's not the be-all solution to many tech problems.

Blockchain standards organizations, universities and start-ups have proposed newer consensus protocols and methods for spreading out the computational and data storage workload to enable greater transactional throughput and overall scalability – a persistent problem for blockchain.  And the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Project has created modular tools for building out blockchain collaboration networks.

While some industry groups are working toward standardizing versions of blockchain software, there are also hundreds of startups working on their own versions of the distributed ledger technology.

## [Introduction](#introduction)
This repository contains source code for CCBLOCKCHAIN "Blockchain Technology basic essentials that focuses on Basic and Intermediate concepts, codes and algorithm for Blockchain development.

#### ✨ Course Description:
This course is a advance topic that I've created in my own knowledge and source of collective information - Fundamentals of Programming is required. The course covers advanced topics in Blockchain development to train students in developing decentralize application. Topics to be covered include history of blockchain technology, consensus algorithm, solidity, dApp, EVM, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Chainlink, and many more.

#### ✨ Course outcomes:
At the end of the course, the student must be able to: 
1. Basic and advance understanding of blockchain development
2. Create a smart contract using solidity
3. Implement Object-Oriented in program design
4. Create and document decentralize application that uses a consensus algorithm
